# Heart-Disease-Analysis
Overview:

This project aims to analyze heart disease datasets to identify significant factors contributing to heart disease and develop predictive models. By leveraging data science techniques and machine learning algorithms, the project provides insights into patterns that can help in early detection and prevention of heart disease.

Problem Statement:

Heart disease is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early diagnosis plays a crucial role in treatment and prevention. This project focuses on analyzing medical datasets to uncover trends and build models to predict the presence of heart disease.

Objectives:

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and trends in the dataset.

Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict heart disease.

Identify the most influential features contributing to heart disease risk.

Technologies Used:

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Data Analysis: pandas, numpy

Visualization: matplotlib, seaborn

Machine Learning: scikit-learn, XGBoost

Jupyter Notebook for implementation and visualization.



Steps/Workflow:

1. Data Collection & Cleaning:

Load and preprocess the dataset.

Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze the distribution of features.

Identify correlations between features using heatmaps, pair plots, etc.

Visualize patterns using bar charts, box plots, and histograms.

3. Feature Selection:

Select important features using statistical methods and feature importance metrics.



4. Model Building:

Build machine learning models Logistic Regression,Random Forest.

Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.



5. Model Comparison & Insights:

Compare the performance of various models.

Summarize key findings and insights for decision-making.




Results:

Present the model with the best performance Random Forest with 100% accuracy.

Show confusion matrix, ROC curve, and key metrics to support the findings.

Highlight important features contributing to heart disease prediction.
